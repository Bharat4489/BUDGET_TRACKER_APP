    run_main_app()
# This script serves as the entry point for the application, starting the main GUI.
# It imports the run_main_app function from the ui.main_gui module and executes it.
# The run_main_app function initializes and runs the main application interface.
# This allows for a clean separation of concerns, keeping the application logic in the main_gui module.
